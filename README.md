# Project Portfolio

Small collection of notable projects I completed while completing my CSC degreee at NCSU.

### Running a Project

To run one of the two projects, do the following:

1. Clone the repository
2. Download Docker for Desktop
3. While in the directory for one of the projects ( `/Howler(Twitter Clone)` or `/GrocerEZ`)
- Open Docker Desktop
- Run `docker compose up --build` in the terminal
- Navigate to `localhost:80` in your web browser of choice to view the application
